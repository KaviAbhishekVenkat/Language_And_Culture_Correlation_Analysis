# Language and Culture Correlation Analysis

  The language is a product of the culture associated with its speakers. This means, if a community identifies something as positive, then the language should support it by providing words that have a positive sentiment. This brings up an interesting hypothesis, if a set of distinct scenarios with varying sentiments associated for each community is analyzed for each community, given a particular test scenario and a language describing it, we can identify the community. 
  To test this hypothesis, we choose the scenarios as the movies produced in different languages. The interpretation of the scenario is given by the set of dialogues retrieved from the subtitle files. 
  Due to our limitation of performing sentiment analysis only for the English language, we perform a translation of all the other languages int english before starting our analysis. 


## Getting Started

We have written the project as jupyter notebooks using python3. To simply run the project, clone this repo and open the notebook through jupyter. make sure all the data files are downloaded properly and are in the same directory as the notebook.
